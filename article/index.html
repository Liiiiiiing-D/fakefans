            This page shows some real Instagram pages of "fake followers". The purpose of creating this work is very simple. Just like the name of this webpage and the name of this work, it is to show what the "false followers" are. As social media becomes more and more important in people’s lives, people are more concerned about the feedback they receive on social media. The number of "followers" and "likes" has become the most intuitive feedback data. In such an environment and background, the market for “fake fans” has to become so huge that most people who are keen on using social media know the existence of fake data, but in fact, few people can tell which accounts are part of these automation technologies? This is interesting things because these data accounts have been able to show extremely real on today's social media. Most of the "fake accounts" look like accounts operated by real people, which are difficult to distinguish. Is this the person who has become the data or the data created by the person?

            Therefore, this page collects a batch of real Instagram account homepages purchased from the "fake fan" service, hoping to show the people behind these accounts in a form of network data. The account number is superimposed on the roulette generated by a code so that the audience can randomly select a user by sliding the mouse wheel and can see some basic information about him, and click on their avatar to enter their homepage. And the light spot in the background can also change with the movement of the mouse as if connected to a virtual network. Through the operation of the mouse, you can explore some interesting things in this connected web.

            Now, on Instagram, it is easy to find a company that sells "fake fans" services. The accounts of these companies have already made no secret of writing keywords such as "fan growth" and their contact information on their homepage pictures or avatar pictures. Of course, in some cases, they will directly use the Instagram logo as their avatar, perhaps their main target customers have already known that this is the way this service organization displays. However, most service organizations will not choose to conduct transactions on Instagram, and will not indicate their service prices on the Instagram page. Although some accounts will post screenshots of transaction chats with customers as part of their advertising materials, most of these Such accounts only simply decorated their homepages, and many of them even repeated a picture stating their general service direction. Some promotional pictures will include their personal contact information, while others need to send DM to ask them for detailed transaction channels. Some of these more mature companies even have their own commercial websites, and buyers can choose the services they need to purchase on the websites without directly contacting them. Under normal circumstances, such a service organization does not only provide followers to purchase this service but also provides a variety of social services including "followers", "likes", "comments" and "video views". Data services of the platform. And the price of these data also varies according to their quality. For example, take followers as an example. The so-called "real followers" are the most expensive. These followers can even choose according to region, gender, and interest direction. These companies claim that as long as they provide some target accounts with many followers, they can choose your followers for you among their followers. This kind of private customized "fake fans" is also the most valuable among them, with an average of 1,000-2,000 "real followers" for every $100, which is also the most popular. According to the introduction of several "follower companies", this service is popular with accounts with commercial purposes, although they cannot guarantee that these "real people following" will reply to messages or purchase goods. For customers who do not have that much budget to acquire "fake fans", they will recommend a combination of "real followers" and "zombie followers". "Zombie Follower" is a cheaper product than "real follower", and generally only needs to pay half or less for "real follower". The "follower company" honestly stated that these accounts are just data. These accounts do not design user names and personal dynamics, but simply increase the number of followers. Similar to the "fake followers" service is the "comment" service. The "review" service includes expensive "customized reviews" and cheap "random reviews". The rest of the data services, such as "likes" or "video views", are priced very cheaply and are set as value-added bonuses for the previous two services. In addition, the technological progress of these "follower companies" is faster than expected. According to the introduction of the "follower companies" learned, half or a year ago, the technology they used also required customers to provide account passwords. In a period of time, they will assist in the management of the account, and new technologies and can provide the most data without obstacles.

            For this webpage, I purchased a new technology "Real Followers" from the "Followers" company for $100. They promised to give me 200 "likes" for each of my ten new developments in the future and recommended I to pay an additional $10 These 1,000 followers slowly increased over the next month. They claim that this makes my account look natural and popular. In the past half month, I have received these "followers" and "likes" as agreed. These "live followers" do seem to be indistinguishable from real people. Except for individual private accounts, most of the accounts are completely decorated. Although the homepage dynamics of some accounts are not very rich, it is still difficult not to think that this is a real account. You can clearly see all kinds of people. They come from different countries, have different skin colors, and most of them use languages ​​that I am not familiar with. These accounts have their various lives, their lovely selfies, their family and friends, their sweet love, and their wonderful holidays. They will post recent updates and get comments and interactions. Some even post stories every day. All this seems so real. The only strange thing may be that the messages I sent to them never got a reply. In fact, although during this period of time, all my new activities can receive 200 "likes" from the "follower company", none of them came from these "real followers", and they also Never watch my daily story. Although these things are suspicious, there is no evidence that these accounts were designed and created because it is not known where the source of these specific and rich picture samples is.

            In the fourth week of this semester, we discussed the content of "horse bot" in the reading materials. This article really made me interested in the role of automation in online media, and thus started the idea of ​​this project. If bot-type accounts such as "horse bot" are an exploration of human beings in the direction of imitating non-human language expression on social media, then the "real follower" service can be regarded as a way of imitating human expression for non-human systems. Try. Such mentioned in his article the concept of "humanization" of artificial intelligence technology, that is, embodying power, emotion, and sociality are used to assess the level of humans in artificial intelligence, which also measures the extent to which a machine participates in the human world. . The popularity of social media provides a purer verification platform for this standard. The emergence of social media can be regarded as simplifying the process of human self-definition to some extent. As social media is becoming more and more dependent on people, embodying power, emotion and sociality have become important criteria for human survival in social media. And based on such standards, designing or creating an inhuman image similar to a person becomes simple. This kind of creation not only appears in these "real followers", but also appears more in virtual celebrities. Whether it's the virtual idol trend that started in Japan and now stretches to the world, or the October image that has been sought after on live broadcasts and social media in recent years, or even the CG model that has often appeared in brand advertisements and endorsements recently. These images that confuse the boundary between humans and robots are gradually gaining more and more influence on social media. No matter how individuals understand the differences between these automated network images and people, the value that these roles can create in business has long been recognized. If the logical relationship between the influence of social media and people is that people obtain social media value through actual production value and display these values ​​in social media, then non-human accounts are obtained through social media. The obtained influence value is transformed into the actual market value. From Suchma’s point of view, the necessity of social media is like a catalyst that blurs the boundary between humans and non-humans, because the power, emotion, and sociality are already reflected in the new era of personal value definition standards constructed by social media. It has become an important part of personal cognition in the Internet age, and it can even be said that this has become one of the most important standards in many areas that rely on influence.

            Just like these "fake followers", the biggest consumers of this type of service are celebrities who rely on data and traffic to define their self-worth. Here is an amazing example. In China's star market, a popular idol has long been inseparable from the support of these false data. Normally, the fan base of a newcomer idol must be managed mechanically and bureaucratically to create enough data traffic for them, which has already become the most direct number that defines the value of a star. And what fans get from these "follower company" technologies is not only the right follower data, but also the voting data of various competitions and activities, or the performance of each of these stars and idols. Feedback can be created directly with money and data. These values ​​also mean a person’s value in the business market. Whether it is a celebrity who relies on gaining influence support to work or those Instagram celebrities who change their lives through online influence, their lives are based on automated data. Up. From this perspective, do these celebrities look more like humans or robots?
